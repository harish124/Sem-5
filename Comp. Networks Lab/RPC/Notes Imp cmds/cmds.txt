rpcgen -C fib.x
rpcgen -a -C fib.x

edit server and client files

make -f MakeFile.fib
./fib_server in 1 terminal and ./fib_client localhost in another

if programs are not running 
check rpcinfo if that's not working install rpcbind
restart terminals
still programs are not working run the below code
sudo service rpcbind restart #in case rpcbind is not working

That's it.
